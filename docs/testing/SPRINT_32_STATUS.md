## 📋 In Progress

### Current Focus: React Stability + Unit Testing

**Priority P0 Issues:**
1. 🔴 **React Multiple Instances** - Critical blocker
   - Error: `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useRef')`
   - Root cause: Vite bundling creating duplicate React instances
   - Solution applied: Explicit aliases + dedupe + force optimization
   - Status: Testing fix deployment

2. 🟡 **UI Density System** - Infrastructure ready
   - ✅ Created `design-tokens.css` with spacing tokens
   - ✅ Created `DensityContext` for mode switching
   - ⏳ Pending: Apply to components after React fix
