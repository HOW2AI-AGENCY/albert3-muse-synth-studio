# MobileNavigation (Unused)

**Created:** 2024
**Archived:** 2025-11-18

**Reason for Archiving:** Replaced by the new `AppBottomNav` component system.

This component was an alternative implementation of the mobile navigation that utilized a drawer for showing more items.

The new `AppBottomNav` in production uses a more standard bottom tab bar layout combined with a `Sheet` for overflow items, which better aligns with native iOS and Android patterns and the recommendations from the UX audit of 2025-11-18.

This code is preserved here for historical reference. If a drawer-style navigation is needed in the future, the logic within this component could be a useful starting point. See the git history for this file for its last active state.
