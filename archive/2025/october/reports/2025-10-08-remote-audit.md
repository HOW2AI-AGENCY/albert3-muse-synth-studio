# 2025-10-08 Remote Audit Summary

**Auditor**: copilot (GitHub-native assistant)

## Project Overview
- **Focus**: AI-assisted platform for generating full music tracks with vocals.
- **Primary Stack**: TypeScript (~95%), with supporting CSS, JavaScript, and PL/pgSQL for database-side logic.

## Key Findings
### Architecture & Code Quality
- TypeScript configuration is likely not using `strict` mode, raising runtime defect risk.
- Lack of clear modular boundaries plus heavy AI/model dependencies complicate maintenance and onboarding.

### Data & Database Operations
- PL/pgSQL routines point to business logic in the database layer; missing versioned migrations jeopardize data integrity.
- Potential drift between application schema expectations and live database state.

### CI/CD & Tooling
- Absent or incomplete CI pipelines mean code can merge without linting, type-checking, or tests.
- Limited automated test coverage, especially across ML/audio pipelines, increases regression risk.

### Security & Compliance
- Repository history may contain API keys or large binary artifacts; automated secret scanning is not confirmed.
- No evidence of automated dependency monitoring (Dependabot/Renovate), allowing vulnerable packages to persist.

### Operations & Cost Management
- Model execution is resource-intensive; lacking monitoring for compute usage, queues, and cost controls.
- Centralized observability (logs, metrics, alerts) for production incidents appears absent.

## Risk Prioritization
- **High**: secret leakage, missing CI quality gates, unmanaged database migrations, inadequate ML pipeline tests.
- **Medium**: dependency drift, inconsistent formatting/TypeScript rules, insufficient operational monitoring.
- **Low**: frontend optimization debt, documentation available only in Russian.

## Recommended Immediate Actions (Sprint 0)
1. **Repository Health Check** – collect `package.json`, TypeScript configs, CI workflow files, migration scripts, and Dockerfiles for an in-depth audit.
2. **Secret & Artifact Scan** – run git history scanners for credentials and oversized binaries; prepare remediation or key rotation as needed.

## Suggested Sprint Roadmap
- **Sprint 1** – Stand up CI pipeline (lint → typecheck → test → build); enable Dependabot/Renovate; enforce linting/formatting hooks.
- **Sprint 2** – Move TypeScript configuration toward `strict`; resolve `any` usages in critical modules.
- **Sprint 3** – Introduce structured database migrations and add automated tests for PL/pgSQL routines.
- **Sprint 4** – Implement integration tests for ML/audio pipelines and externalize model artifacts from git.
- **Sprint 5** – Deploy observability stack (Sentry, metrics dashboards) and establish cost monitoring.

## Backlog Issue Templates
1. **CI: базовый pipeline (lint, typecheck, test, build)**
2. **Security: сканирование истории репозитория на секреты и крупные файлы**
3. **TypeScript: план по включению strict mode**
4. **DB: миграции и тесты для PL/pgSQL**
5. **ML: интеграционные тесты для генерации треков**
6. **Ops: настройка Sentry и метрик**
