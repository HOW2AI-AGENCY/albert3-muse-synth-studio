## 📅 Week 1 Progress (Nov 1-7)

**Status:** 🟢 ON TRACK
**Completion:** 30% of Week 1 goals

---

## ✅ Completed This Week

### 1. Critical Bug Fixes (Unplanned)
**Priority:** P1 (CRITICAL)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

Fixed three critical bugs affecting user experience:

#### VER-001: Track Version Count Display
- **Problem:** Track cards showed 3 versions instead of 2
- **Solution:** Fixed `uiVersionCount` calculation in `useTrackCardState.ts`
- **Impact:** Users now see accurate version count
- **Files:** `src/features/tracks/components/card/useTrackCardState.ts`

#### VER-002: Track Version Duplication in Player
- **Problem:** Player showed duplicate versions (main track appeared twice)
- **Solution:** Added check for `variant_index: 0` before adding main track
- **Impact:** Clean version list, correct playback behavior
- **Files:** `src/features/tracks/api/trackVersions.ts`

#### TEST-001: Test Suite Fixes After Merge
- **Problem:** `useGeneratorState` tests failed after merging with main
- **Solution:** Updated test expectations to match current API
- **Impact:** All 10/10 tests passing (2 skipped)
- **Files:** `tests/unit/hooks/useGeneratorState.test.ts`

**Documentation:** [BUG_FIXES_2025-11-07.md](../../docs/BUG_FIXES_2025-11-07.md)

### 2. Test Coverage Improvements
**Status:** 🟡 IN PROGRESS

#### Fixed Tests:
- ✅ `useGeneratorState.test.ts` - 10/10 passing (2 skipped)
- ✅ `formatters.test.ts` - 14/14 passing

#### Test Infrastructure:
- ✅ Vitest configured and working
- ✅ Build validation passing
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode enforced
