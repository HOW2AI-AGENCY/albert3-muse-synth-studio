## 🚨 Blockers & Risks

### Active Blockers
1. **Leaked Password Protection** (MANUAL)
   - **Action**: User must enable in Supabase Dashboard
   - **Impact**: Blocks security compliance
   - **Priority**: HIGH

### Risks
| Risk | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| Zustand migration breaks features | MEDIUM | Feature flags, gradual rollout |
| Performance regression | LOW | Lighthouse CI, pre-release testing |
| Test flakiness | MEDIUM | Stable selectors, retry logic |
